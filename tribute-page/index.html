    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Aaoron Swartz was a brilliant computer programmer and internet activist who committed suicide at the age of 26 in January 2013 while under the overzealous prosecution where he faced 13 felony charges, 35 years in prison, and $1 million fine for unauthorized
      bulk-downloading of 4.8 million scientific articles from JSTOR database at MIT in 2011. <sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab
      on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act. <sup><a href="#cite3">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      He has also developed the site theinfo.org. His landmark analysis of Wikipedia, Who Writes Wikipedia?, has been widely cited. Working with Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee at MIT, he helped develop and popularize standards for sharing data on the Web. He
      also coauthored the RSS 1.0 specification, now widely used for publishing news stories. In 2007, he led the development of the nonprofit Open Library, an ambitious project to collect information about every book ever published. He also cofounded
      the online news site Reddit, where he released as free software the web framework he developed, web.py.<sup><a href="#cite4">[4]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 11, 2014, marking the first anniversary of his death, a sneak preview was released from The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz, a documentary about Swartz, the NSA and SOPA. The film was officially released at the January 2014 Sundance
      Film Festival. <sup><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup> It was also released on the Internet with a Creative Commons license. <sup><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup>
